# Predicting-Energy-Performance-of-Residential-Buildings
This project involves an exploratory analysis of data on energy performance of residential buidlings comparing the effects of eight input variables on two output variables (heating and cooling load)

This is based on the paper A. Tsanas, A. Xifara: “Accurate quantitative estimation of energy performance of residential buildings using statistical machine learning tools”, Energy and Buildings, Vol. 49, pp. 560-567, 2012. amd dataset used in it. 

I was able to engineer a much lower mean squared error (MSE) and therefore get better predictions.
